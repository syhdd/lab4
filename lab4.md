# Why is license important?
Because without a proper set of license, you might unclear about what your software can do and can't  
(like distruibution or code modification)  
Also, others can't use your code unless your specify your license  
Considered of business models, a wrong license will lead you to lawsuits  
# Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?  
Because a project with out specifying the license will leads you to potential danger  
If it is actually open source or free licensed, but your project is private
or if it is for private use, and you use it with out the permission,  
Both case will cause you trouble  
So keep yourself away from unspecified projects  
# Gopher Story
I agree with this statement, as these paper mentions before, there are many reasons leads to the failure of gopher  
technical reasons, social reason, publicity etc... But the closed development environment is definitely an important reason  
Unlike many Proprietary software, the internet protocols is within much change and complicity  
Also, unlike many software, internet protocols is more user-intensive 
Which means that it needs a lot of interaction and reflextion  
Just technical advantages can't win users hear 
However, gopher's team fails to let the users involved in part of the development 
which distracts potential users(early times more likely to be familiar with computers)  
Also, they did not follow the standard which means it will be harder and harder to be compatiable with onther protocols as time goes.
# Why Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2?
First we know that GPL2.0 must disclose codes  
However Apche allows code disclosure but it is not forced to do so  
This means most of the part of the Android is using Apache and its core is licensed under GPL2.0  
It is simply because that Android which is developped by google is intended to be redevlopped by commercial companies  
Those commercial companies can choose to develop their own enhanced features and to keep it as an asvantage  
instead of sharing it with competitors  
Thus Android system is more attrative to many companys for this needs in scarifice a chance to build a 
better and more powerful system with the help all across the community
