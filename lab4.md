#Why is license important?
Because without a proper set of license, you might unclear about what your software can do and can't  
(like distruibution or code modification)  
Also, others can't use your code unless your specify your license  
Considered of business models, a wrong license will lead you to lawsuits  
#Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?  
Because a project with out specifying the license will leads you to potential danger  
If it is actually open source or free licensed, but your project is private
or if it is for private use, and you use it with out the permission,  
Both case will cause you trouble  
So keep yourself away from unspecified projects
